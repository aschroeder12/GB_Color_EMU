/* HALT
 * Enter CPU low-power consumption mode until an interrupt occurs. 
 * The exact behavior of this instruction depends on the state of the IME flag.
 * 
 * IME set
 * 	- The CPU enters low-power mode until after an interrupt is about to be serviced. 
 * 	- The handler is executed normally, and the CPU resumes execution after the HALT when that returns.
 * 
 * IME not set
 * 	- The behavior depends on whether an interrupt is pending (i.e. ‘[IE] & [IF]’ is non-zero).
 * 		- None pending
 * 			As soon as an interrupt becomes pending, the CPU resumes execution. This is like the above, except that the handler is not called.
 * 		- Some pending
 * 			The CPU continues execution after the HALT, but the byte after it is read twice in a row (PC is not incremented, due to a hardware bug).
 * TODO
